# Clustering Algorithms Overview

This README provides a brief overview of several clustering algorithms commonly used in machine learning applications. These algorithms are implemented in the scikit-learn library in Python.

## 1. K-Means Clustering

### Description
K-Means is a partitioning method that divides the data into K clusters. It assigns each data point to the cluster with the nearest mean.

### Parameters
- `n_clusters`: Number of clusters to form.

## 2. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

### Description
DBSCAN groups together data points based on a density criterion. It identifies core points, reachable points, and outliers.

### Parameters
- `eps`: Maximum distance for points in the same neighborhood.
- `min_samples`: Minimum number of samples in a neighborhood.

## 3. Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering

### Description
Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters. Agglomerative clustering starts with individual data points as separate clusters and merges them until one cluster remains.

### Parameters
- `n_clusters`: Number of clusters to form.

## 4. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

### Description
GMM models data as a mixture of Gaussian distributions. It assigns probabilities of belonging to each cluster for each data point.

### Parameters
- `n_components`: Number of Gaussian components (clusters).

## Usage
These clustering algorithms are used for various clustering tasks, and the appropriate choice depends on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis.
